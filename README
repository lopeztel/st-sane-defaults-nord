st - simple terminal
--------------------
st is a simple terminal emulator for X which sucks less.


Requirements
------------
In order to build st you need the Xlib header files.


Installation
------------
Edit config.mk to match your local setup (st is installed into
the /usr/local namespace by default).

Afterwards enter the following command to build and install st (if
necessary as root):

    make clean install


Running st
----------
If you did not install st with make clean install, you must compile
the st terminfo entry with the following command:

    tic -sx st.info

See the man page for additional details.

My changes
----------
This was created based on [st 0.8.2](https://dl.suckless.org/st/st-0.8.2.tar.gz) , the patch added on [st-sane-defaults](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/st-sane-defaults/)

```
wget https://dl.suckless.org/st/st-0.8.2.tar.gz
wget https://st.suckless.org/patches/nordtheme/st-nordtheme-0.8.2.diff
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/st-sane-defaults.git
cp st-sane-defaults/sane-defaults-patch.diff ./
tar -zxvf st-0.8.2.tar.gz
patch -d st-0.8.2 < st-sane-defaults/sane-defaults-patch.diff
